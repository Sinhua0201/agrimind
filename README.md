# 🌱 Project Overview

AgriMind is a smart farming web app using AI and real-time data to support Malaysian farmers with weather forecasts, crop insights, risk alerts, and pest detection for better yield and sustainability. 🌾📊🌦️

## 🌟 Features

🏠 Homepage Dashboard
Overview of real-time weather, interactive field map, latest risk alerts, and quick access to all key tools.

🌦️ Weather Page
Displays 12 Malaysian states' weather data including temperature, humidity, and forecasts for smarter planning.

🗺️ Field Map Page
Filter by crop (All, Rice, Corn) with region-specific data like temp, soil moisture, weather, and forecast yield. Includes map-based field popups and yield history charts.

🚨 Risk Dashboard Page
Visualizes temperature, humidity, and wind data with risk heatmaps (High, Medium, Low). Includes notification logs and risk source breakdowns (weather, soil, pest, etc.).

🤖 AI Assistant Page
Ask farming-related questions in natural language (e.g., best planting times, fertilizer tips). Powered by Gemini API with localised advice.

🐛 Pest Detection Page
Upload pest images to identify species and get crop impact insights using AI image analysis.

📈 Analytics & Reports Page
Graphs for monthly yield comparison, price trends, and income simulation. Option to download reports for corn and rice.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
